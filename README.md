# Extract, Load  Transform (ELT)

ELT (Extract, Load, Transform) and Reverse ETL are two commonly used data integration processes that are used to move data between different systems.

#### ELT (Extract, Load, Transform)

ELT is an acronym for “extract, load, and transform.” It describes a data integration process that extracts, loads, and transforms data from one or more sources into a repository such as a data warehouse or data lake.

The ELT process consists of three steps:

Extract: Data is extracted from one or more sources, such as IoT data, social platform data, cloud, or on-premises systems.
Load: Raw data is loaded into a data lake or data warehouse.
Transform: The data is transformed into actionable business intelligence.
