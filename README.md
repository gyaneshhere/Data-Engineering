# Extract, Transform Load (ETL) & Reverse ETL

ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) and Reverse ETL are two commonly used data integration processes that are used to move data between different systems.

#### ETL (Extract, Transform, Load)

ETL is a process that is used to extract data from a source system, transform it into the required format, and then load it into a destination system. This is a common approach for importing data from external sources, such as files or other databases, and preparing it for use in the destination system.

The extract step involves retrieving the data from the source system and extracting it into a format that can be processed by the ETL process. This typically involves reading the data from the source system and then converting it into a standard format, such as CSV or JSON.

The transform step involves transforming the extracted data into the required format for the destination system. This may involve cleaning the data, performing calculations, or combining data from multiple sources.

The load step involves loading the transformed data into the destination system. This may involve inserting the data into a database, updating an existing dataset, or writing the data to a file.

#### Reverse ETL

Reverse ETL, on the other hand, is a process that is used to move data from a destination system back to a source system. This is typically used when data has been updated or changed in the destination system, and the changes need to be reflected in the source system. Reverse ETL follows the same steps as regular ETL, but in reverse order: it loads the data from the destination system, transforms it into the required format, and then extracts it back into the source system.
